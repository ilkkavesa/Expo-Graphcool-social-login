**Note:** 

This was needed around summer 2017 when Expo.io and Auth0.com refused to support each other for React Native apps authentication:

After long and useless emails with Auth0 support, decided it's just easier to drop it and rewrite the whole thing with new beta features Graph.cool was developing.

# Expo-Graphcool-social-login

Test app to try new Graphcool schema extension with Expo Facebook and Google social logins.
